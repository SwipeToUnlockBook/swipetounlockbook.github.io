          <p> Here's our list the best non-technical roles available at tech companies.</p>

          <p><em>Note: the application for some of these jobs is only open during certain times of the year. If a job is closed, we've tried to include a link to the best place to find the job once it opens.</em></p>

          <p>We did our best to make this list as comprehensive as possible, but there are always more jobs that we couldn't fit here. If there is a tech company you are interested in that’s not on this list, it doesn’t mean they aren’t hiring. Go
            to their career page and explore!</p>
