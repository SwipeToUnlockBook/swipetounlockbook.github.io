# FAQs for Neel

People often ask me about my story and my journey in tech, so I thought I'd answer some of the most commonly-asked questions here.

## Being a Product Manager at Google

### What's it like being an Associate Product Manager (APM) at Google?

[The APM program](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-prepare-for-your-google-apm-interviews-b665584c13fc) is fantastic. The gist is that brand-new product managers do two one-year rotations on vastly different teams around Google (and around the world!) After two years, APMs usually auto-promote to full-fledged Google PMs.

A few things that set the APM program apart:

* **Awesome mentorship.** You get an APM buddy (someone who's already done a year of the APM program), a former APM  to be your mentor, and a management coach (who usually only teaches VPs) who works with you one-on-one.
* **A built-in network of friends and allies.** Each class of APMs is about 40-45 people, and you get very close very quickly. Besides being great friends, fellow APMs are great for getting advice, being connected to resources, and hearing what else is going on around the company. APMs are pretty entrepreneurial, so it's a great way to befriend potential cofounders too.
* **An illustrious alumni base.** Marissa Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo, started the program years ago. Many VPs at Google are former APMs, as are many startup CEOs. The best part is that you get to meet them at APM reunions, and they're very excited to talk to and mentor current APMs.
* **Being at Google.** Google is an amazing place to work. Yes, there are all the perks like unlimited free food, pinball machines, on-site laundry and haircuts, and those quirky bikes you can ride around campus. But more importantly, everyone at Google is so competent, open to learning, and easy to work with.  For that reason, it's an incredible place to start your career. Plus, Google has perfected the art of running a company: how to motivate employees, how to structure hierarchy properly, how to do metrics and user experience, etc. So if you want to start your own company someday, you'll find the experience very useful.

### What's your day-to-day work like?

If you didn't know any better, you'd think I do nothing but run to meetings, send emails, and write Google Docs.

In a sense I do -- those are the tools of the trade. But bigger picture, my work breaks down into strategy and execution.

Strategy involves deciding what we're going to build. I work with marketers, engineers, UI/UX designers, and my team leads to come up with ideas about what our product's next steps are. I'm currently on Google Doodles, so this involves figuring out how Doodles can, for instance, bring delight to more users. Sometimes the seeds of these ideas come from my team lead or various folks inside the team, but other times I'll do a lot of brainstorming and pitch an idea to my manager and team lead. Google is very bottom-up, so if you have an idea you can get resources and time to work on it if you can pitch it well.

Execution involves getting the thing built. The core insight here is that you have to clear the way for the engineers to build the product as best they can. This means figuring out what's blocking our engineers and getting it cleared out of the way. For instance, if there's a debate among UI people about the color of a button, I talk to them and get an agreement reached so that my engineer doesn't have to worry about that. I also handle a lot of the bureaucracy, such as getting approval from privacy and legal. This way, the engineers can focus on what they do best -- developing software -- and not the other stuff. (Why the focus on engineers? No matter how great your plans are, they're useless unless your engineers can build it out. Engineers are essential.)

### How does Google compare to Microsoft?

I interned as a PM at Microsoft before working at Google. I can't say I'm an expert at Microsoft, but I'll share a few of my initial insights.

Google is pretty bottom-up in that even a junior PM can propose an idea and run with it if it gets approval. That said, you have to align your ideas with what higher-ups are worrying about -- if you can align your idea with higher-ups' pain points, you can often get approval. So even junior PMs can think about strategy. At Microsoft, I found that higher-up PMs tend to think of what the product will be (strategy) and delegate the design of individual components to more junior PMs. Microsoft PMs do a lot of execution (from my admittedly limited experience), while Google PMs get more of a mix of strategy and execution. Microsoft higher-ups own the solution, while Google higher-ups own the problems.



### How can I prepare for an Associate Product Manager (APM) interview?

I'd recommend reading [my article about how to prep for PM interviews](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-prepare-for-your-google-apm-interviews-b665584c13fc).

The top books you should read include:

* [Cracking the PM Interview](http://a.co/d/9si7xfx) for an introduction to PM and PM interviews
* [Decode and Conquer](http://a.co/d/8keIVJF) for more thorough practice questions
* [Swipe to Unlock](http://a.co/d/iHtms2m) for explanations of important tech concepts, tech industry trends, and business strategy

### Can you refer me to Google?

Sorry, I'm only allowed to refer people I've personally worked with in the past.

### You didn't answer my question above!

Email your question to neelmehta96@gmail.com and I'll try to add it to this page if it's a common question.

My co-author [Parth](parth) has his own FAQ, which covers some other questions you may be interested in.

### What can I do if I still really want to have a 15 minute phone call to pick your brain on something not covered above?

I’ll trade you my thoughts for yours. If you read my book, [Swipe to Unlock](http://a.co/d/iHtms2m), and share your honest feedback, I’ll make time to chat with you. Write a review on Amazon that’s at least two paragraphs of sincere feedback and send the review URL to the email address above or message it to me on LinkedIn. It doesn’t have to be a glowing positive review, just your honest thoughts and constructive criticism. We update the book about every two months based on feedback we get, because we genuinely want to make it useful as possible :)
