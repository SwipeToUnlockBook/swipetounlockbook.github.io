# FAQs for Neel

People often ask me about my story and my journey in tech, so I thought I'd answer some of the most commonly-asked questions here.

## Being a Product Manager at Google



### How can I prepare for an Associate Product Manager (APM) interview?

I'd recommend reading [my article about how to prep for PM interviews](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-prepare-for-your-google-apm-interviews-b665584c13fc).

The top books you should read include:

* [Cracking the PM Interview](http://a.co/d/9si7xfx) for an introduction to PM and PM interviews
* [Decode and Conquer](http://a.co/d/8keIVJF) for more thorough practice questions
* [Swipe to Unlock](http://a.co/d/iHtms2m) for explanations of important tech concepts, tech industry trends, and business strategy

### Can you refer me to Google?

Sorry, I'm only allowed to refer people I've personally worked with in the past.

## Others

### You didn't answer my question above!

Email your question to neelmehta96@gmail.com and I'll try to add it to this page if it's a common question.

My co-author [Parth](parth) has his own FAQ, which covers some other questions you may be interested in.

### What can I do if I still really want to have a 15 minute phone call to pick your brain on something not covered above?

Iâ€™ll trade you my thoughts for yours. If you read my book, [Swipe to Unlock](http://a.co/d/iHtms2m), and share your honest feedback, Iâ€™ll make time to chat with you. Write a review on Amazon thatâ€™s at least two paragraphs of sincere feedback and send the review URL to the email address above or message it to me on LinkedIn. It doesnâ€™t have to be a glowing positive review, just your honest thoughts and constructive criticism. We update the book about every two months based on feedback we get, because we genuinely want to make it useful as possible ðŸ˜Š
