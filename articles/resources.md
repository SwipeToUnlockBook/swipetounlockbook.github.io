# Resources for landing a job in tech

As we mentioned in the book, *Swipe to Unlock* isn't an interview question-and-answer book,
and it doesn't go deep into topics preparing your resume, networking, and building your career.

On this page, we're listing some of our recommended resources for anyone looking for a job
in tech -- with a particular focus on product management and non-technical roles.

--Neel, Adi, and Parth

## Content from us

* [Our Master Job List of product and business roles at tech companies](masterjoblist). We've listed dozens of full-time roles, including the top new-grad product management roles around the tech industry. The list isn't tied to any specific year's job postings, so it shouldn't go out of date.
* FAQs for [Neel](faq/neel), [Adi](faq/adi), and [Parth](faq/parth) about our backgrounds, career paths, and lessons learned from our time in the tech industry.
* [Neel's article about Google APM](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-prepare-for-your-google-apm-interviews-b665584c13fc), full of tips for preparing for the interview.
* [Parth's list of interview tips](https://swipetounlock.com/interviewtips) that have helped him get offers at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and more.

## Other useful career resources

* [BreakIntoTech](https://www.breakinto.tech/): Jeremy Schifeling's website full of career-building tips, including lists of recommended jobs, resume advice, and everything in between. The slide decks on this website are awesome.
* [Tech Transparency](http://techtransparency.org/resources): an awesome nonprofit with resources to help you choose a job and company, prepare resumes and cover letters, build your LinkedIn presence, and get the offer.

## Product management resources

* [ThePMInterview.com](https://thepminterview.com/) has a great set of practice interview questions. Practice a few a day when you're preparing for a PM interview!

          <p><h3>General Tech Career Guidance</h3></p>
          <p>For everything from job descriptions of different nontechnical positions at tech companies to resume advice and everything in between, I highly recommend checking out my good friend Jeremy Schifeling’s website. It is filled with tons of great slide decks that I think everyone should read.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.breakinto.tech/">https://www.breakinto.tech/</a></p>

          <p><h3>Product Management</h3></p>
          <p>If you are looking to learn more about what Product Management is all about and get high level overview of what PM interviews are like and how to prepare, check out <i>Cracking the PM Interview</i></p>

          <p><a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782818/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0984782818&linkCode=as2&tag=swipetounlock-20&linkId=7627036ecdb1db855132a0e29cdc87ee"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0984782818&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=swipetounlock-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=swipetounlock-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0984782818" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

          <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615930417/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0615930417&linkCode=as2&tag=swipetounlock-20&linkId=35b9a2cd6544879b241407894dde3dce"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0615930417&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=swipetounlock-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=swipetounlock-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0615930417" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

           <p>I’d definitely start with <i>Cracking the PM Interview</i>. However, if you want more interview questions and answers prep, check out <i>Decode and Conquer</i>. </p>

          <p>I'd recommend starting with <i>Cracking the PM Interview</i> if you are interested in learning more about product management in general and are just beginning to explore the space. If after reading that you are sold on being a PM, definitely pick up a copy of <i>Decode and Conquer</i>. The example interview questions and answers are very helpful.</p>

          <p>Lastly, the <a href="https://collegeproductmanager.com/">collegeproductmanager.com</a> is run by Davis Treybig, a Google Product Manager who got product management offers from both Google (APM) and Facebook (RPM) straight out of college. This website has a ton of helpful information and resources for anyone looking to become a product manager straight out of college.</p>

          <p><h3>Marketing</h3></p>
          <p>Highly recommend <i>Rise Above the Noise</i> for all marketing interviews (and business development/strategy roles as well, but to a lesser extent).</p>

          <p><a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615978428/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0615978428&linkCode=as2&tag=swipetounlock-20&linkId=a58d4ae18e1ba1177e6a52c11ec6cc79"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0615978428&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=swipetounlock-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=swipetounlock-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0615978428" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

          <p><h3>Strategy</h3></p>
          <p>This book is meant for aspiring consultants, but I have found it tremendously useful for all my tech interviews as most tech interviews are actually case based. <i>Case in Point</i> does a great job helping you think using organized frameworks that help you come up with well-structured responses—something all interviewers are looking for, regardless of industry. If you don’t have a business education, I would doubly recommend this book as it goes over a lot of the fundamentals that are essential for all business side tech roles.</p>

          <p><h3>Job Opportunities</h3></p>
