## Interested in becoming a Product Manager at a top company straight out of college?

I'm Neel Mehta and I got hired as a product manager at Google straight out of undergrad. If you're looking to break into product management -- even if you have no prior experience or education -- I hope this article gives you the tools you'll need to succeed.

In this article, I'll cover my tips for how to build your career path and then how to ace your interviews.

## The 3 ingredients you need to get a top PM job

People often ask me, *what do all the top PMs you know have in common?* That is, what was similar in all their career paths? Ideally, aspiring PMs could follow in their footsteps with this knowledge.

I've studied a few dozen people I know, and I've devised a theory that there are three key ingredients.

### Ingredient 1: Know how tech &amp; the industry works

Many people think reading interview prep books and taking certain classes is enough to get a PM job, but I think the real key is to know how tech and the industry works. It's the skill I use the most in my job, and the one that got tested the most in my interviews. For instance, *how does the cloud work?* *What's Amazon's business strategy, and how does that affect its competitors?* *Why did Facebook buy Instagram?*

All my PM peers showed this knowledge, but in very different ways. I'll take [my co-authors of *Swipe to Unlock*](https://swipetounlock.com), Parth Detroja and Adi Agashe, as case studies.

Parth still hasn't learned how to code, but before he got his job as a PM at Facebook he got to know the tech industry by working as a marketer at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Adi, a PM at Microsoft, took computer science and tech strategy courses (showing his book knowledge of the industry), and he founded a tech startup (showing he knew this information in practice). Meanwhile, I'd been building apps and writing about tech for several years before I got the job at Google.

As you can see, we're all over the map. Some great things anyone can do to get this ingredient, even without prior education or experience, are:

* Read and write about technology and business strategy. I did a ton of reading before applying, and compiled most of what I know in [Swipe to Unlock](https://swipetounlock.com), so that should save you some time reading. As for writing, you can write blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com) analyzing recent things you've heard in the tech news (like on [Wired](https://wired.com) or [The Verge](https://theverge.com)) or figuring out tech companies' business strategies. [Parth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parthdetroja/) has some great posts like this on LinkedIn, for instance.
* If you don't have a technical background, do a [business or marketing job/internship at a tech company](https://swipetounlock.com/joblist). This is a great way to pick up industry knowledge without prior tech experience, but bear in mind you should still understand the core concepts of tech and the industry.

### Ingredient 2: Start something

Top companies want go-getters. Most of the top PMs I know have started something: a company, a nonprofit, college clubs, or other projects.

For instance, Parth started a business club at Cornell and has run several "side hustles" (as a kid, he would buy 1-cent iPhone cases on eBay and resell them for a few dollars on Amazon; ask him on LinkedIn for the whole story).  As I mentioned before, Adi started a [tech consultancy startup](http://belleapps.me/). Meanwhile, I started [a tech internship program in the US government](http://codingitforward.com/apply).

Starting a company, nonprofit, or club is a great way to gain this ingredient. But it does take prior knowledge and connections to do this. Some ways to start something even with no prior expertise or education:

* If you know how to code, start a software project on [GitHub](https;//github.com). Fortunately, GitHub is relatively meritocratic; good software usually gets recognition and users. Saying "I made an app with X many users" is a great thing to have on your resume.
* Join a community group that needs tech help. This is a fantastic way to gain experience, because they really need help and will thrust their biggest challenges on you as long as you're interested. I'm part of [Code for San Francisco](https://codeforsanfrancisco.org/), which creates software for the city, and it's been a great way for people new to PM to get experience starting a real project and working with big teams. I highly recommend checking out [your local Code for America brigade](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) or something similar in your town.


### Ingredient 3: Gain expertise in software development or business

Finally, you have to prove that *you could be a competent software engineer or business analyst if you really had to.* That is, you should know how to build apps or analyze business (or both, if you're feeling ambitious).

For my coauthors, this ingredient came from education. Parth studied business in undergrad, I studied computer science, and Adi studied both. But other PMs I know have no formal training in computer science or business; they built apps, worked as a software engineer or consultant, or did an MBA (part-time or full-time).

Besides formally studying CS or business, a few ways you can gain this expertise:

* Build apps, as I mentioned before. In this case, nobody has to use your app (though it would be nice if they did) -- just proving you *can* build something is enough. Coding bootcamps or online courses can help you learn how to code.
* Write about business strategy, as I mentioned.
* Find a startup or nonprofit in your town and offer to help them with coding, marketing, etc.


## How to ace your interviews

Now that I've explained how to set yourself up for success, here's how to really break into tech and get your dream PM job.

I wrote earlier about [how to prepare for the Google Associate Product Manager interview](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-prepare-for-your-google-apm-interviews-b665584c13fc). I highly recommend you give it a read. Those same tips were helpful when I was interviewing for Facebook's Rotational Product Manager program and Microsoftâ€™s Program Manager role, so they should be useful no matter what company you're interested in. In that article I cover:

* How to get an interview (including making a great resume)
* What books to read to prepare, namely [Cracking the PM Interview](http://a.co/6QY8fbF), [Decode and Conquer](http://a.co/dEYfpE0), and [Swipe to Unlock](http://a.co/25YzH1C).
* Additional tips and resources that I found useful

I showed pretty much all my interviewing tips in that article, so I won't repeat myself here -- [give that article a read](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-prepare-for-your-google-apm-interviews-b665584c13fc).

I hope these resources will help propel you from promising candidate to new product manager!

## Got further questions?

I get a lot of questions about my career path, my experience working at different companies, my advice to new PMs, and so on. [I've answered your biggest questions in this FAQ guide](/neel), but feel free to write to me if you have another question that I haven't answered there.
