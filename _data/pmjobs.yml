                Facebook’s RPM program is similar to Associate Product Manager (APM) programs at other tech companies, but unlike many of those companies, Facebook does not require an engineering background to apply.

                This is probably the best program for someone who wants to work at a startup, but only one that is highly vetted and relatively low risk (compared to other startups, not compared to like an established big company like Google, of course).

                The job description mentions wanting two years of work experience, but I’ve heard they consider straight out of undergrad if they have strong previous internship experience.

                You’ll spend your first 2 years as a rotational product manager at Intuit where you’ll get the opportunity to work on a new high-impact project in a different business unit every 6 months to prepare you to become a product leader of tomorrow.  Example projects range from creating a new mobile app to launching a product into a new country. You’ll also receive professional development through mentoring and coaching from product executives, and you’ll get the chance to bond closely with other rotational PMs. After the two-year program, RPM’s will no longer rotate and officially join a product team.
