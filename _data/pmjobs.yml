                I know a few friends who are in the Google APM program and have heard that APMs typically get a lot of responsility. Even though they lack experience, they are given ownership over important projects. Also, one of the perks of the program is the APM trip that each APM class goes on!

            description: |
                Facebook’s RPM program is similar to Associate Product Manager (APM) programs at other tech companies, but unlike many of those companies, Facebook does not require an engineering background to apply. The program optimizes for impact and many RPM projects affect millions, if not billions, of people directly.

                My co-author, Parth, is in this program and he really likes the incredibly supportive community that the RPM program builds. Mentorship is at the core of the RPM program and each RPM has a PM manager who stays with them throughout their program experience to make sure you are developing and growing.

Previous Product Fellows have worked at companies including Uber, Square, Zynga, DocuSign, Handshake, Area 1, One Kings Lane, Kinsa, AppDynamics, and Drawbridge. In the past, KPCB has shared advice on how to apply successfully.

                This is probably the best program for someone who wants to work at a startup, but only one that is highly vetted and relatively low risk (compared to other startups, not compared to like an established big company like Google, of course). KPCB released a <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/blog/how-to-hack-your-kpcb-fellows-application">blog post</a> that gives advice for how the selection process for KPCB fellows works and how to build your application to maximize your chances of getting in.

                Program management is a role at Microsoft that combines user interface design, product management, product development, and business management. PMs own the product spec and their job is to make sure the product is built the way customers will want to use it.
            comments: |
                I really like the program manager role at Microsoft because it allows you to really own a product/feature. Microsoft's new culture shift has made it a priority to be very customer focsued and build products/features that customers will love. I think this role is very unique because in the day to day I am able to handle the business management (owing the P&L, forming partnerships, negotiating with vendors, developing marketing channels) and also focus on product development (making technical product decisions with engineers, understanding customer needs and product positioning, analyzing telemetry data and running A/B tests). I am totally not biased because I work here :P </br> </br>

                This is similar to other APM programs and at Uber you will work on defining and executing on Uber's mission of creating possibilities for riders, drivers, and cities. Uber typically has a homework challenge that you have a few days to complete where you have to design a new feature to build and write a report justifying why.
            comments: |
                Uber is one of the companies that participates in the KPCB Product Fellows Program (mentioned above), so if you get accepted to both positions you could be a KPCB Product Fellow and an Uber APM. The job description mentions wanting a year of product management work experience, but I know some people who have gotten the role straight out of undergrad if they have strong previous internship experience. When I completed the homework challenge, I spent time talking to users to see what problems they faced with Uber and tried to address one of the most common concerns. I inculded mockups and a strong justification (market, customer, and finanical research) in my report. My advice would be to spend a lot of time on the homework challenge because almost every interview I had (3 phone interviews and 2 of the 4 onsite interviews) referenced it.

                Box's program is pretty unique because you can try out product management and also other business roles if you are interested. The first step in the interview process involves recording a video of yourself answering some prerecorded questions, so make sure to get comfortable answering behavioral interview questions while speaking to a camera with no response. I made sure to record myself a few times so that I could carefully craft my answers and body language.

                Workday’s team was very friendly when I interviewed. I know a few APMs at Workday and they really like working there because the company is very focused on creating a easy to understand user experience in all of their products, which many of their competitors struggle with. Overall, I was impressed with the simplicity of their products. My advice would be to research Workday's business model and products before the interviews because many of the questions I was asked dealt with that.

You’ll also receive professional development through mentoring and coaching from product executives, and you’ll get the chance to bond closely with other rotational PMs. After the two-year program, RPM’s will no longer rotate and officially join a product team.
            comments: |
                You may not have heard of Intuit, but they make financial management tools like QuickBooks, TurboTax, and Mint. They have a very strong lockhold on tax advising software as most businesses or individuas who use software for tax preparation use QuickBooks and TurboTax. Also, their acquisition of Mint is really exciting because I see a lot of opportunity for growth. Since Mint aggregates all your financial life in one, easy-to-understand place, they will probably start developing machine learning models to recommend advice on how to save money, manage your finances, and invest your savings.

You will work closely with small teams of engineers to ensure that our software is of the highest quality with a highly intuitive user experience focused first on driving significant value for APT's clients (no small task given the complexity of our analytic approach).
            comments: |
                In case you don't know, APT is a software company that provides business analytics software. They help businesses who are B2C (consumer-facing) by allowing them to test ideas with a small subset of stores, customers, or employees. So, what this means is that APT's predictive analytics software can reveal that answers to "did it work?", "which elements worked the best?", and "how should we roll it out?" APT was acquired by MasterCard in 2015.

                I have a few friends who have worked at Twitter and I have heard great things about the culture at Twitter. They've told me that Twitter has found how to strike a good balance between their product and engineering teams. This is a really good environment for a new APM because there will be a mutually shared genuine respect from both parties. The mission at Twitter is also deeply engrained in the team - the management team is very receptive to ideas that further the mission, which is "to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers."

                Asana's PM team is very strong (former Google, Facebook, and Micrsoft PMs), including Jackie Bavaro (the author of Cracking the PM Interview book). Asana's PM team is very self-aware and they make sure that they strike a balance between engineering, design, ideology, sales, and product teams. This discipline helps Asana iterate quickly and not get carried away with any one initiative, which is why Asana can make big strides in their mission to "empower teams to do great things together."

                Marissa Mayer started the original APM program at Google, so Yahoo's APM program is very similar. Yahoo specifically studies how different cultures perceive the web and consumer technology products to develop products that work well for global users. APMs at yahoo are given a very strong mentorship network and have the opportunity to work with an executive coach on areas like public speaking, presentation skills, time management, etc. Yahoo Directors and VPs host frequent and selective talks for the group, and APMs are expected to attend product reviews with Senior VPs and C-Suite officers.

            comments: |
                PMs at eBay follow a specific product development cycle that involves 5 stages: planning, defining, building, launching, and tuning. In the planning stage, PMs evangelize and prioritize projects across eBay in order to optimize our customer experience. When defining the product, the technical depth of eBay PMs allows them to create a solid, feasible product definition in conjunction with the engineering teams. In the building stage, PMs are responsibile for making sure a top quality product is made so they must remain closely involved with engineers. Launching is exiting since the product is now live! Here, PMs communicate the product improvements within eBay and to customers. Once the new product is launched to eBay customers, PMs assess how well the product meets customer needs. They work with analysts to blend quantitative and qualitative sources of data to understand customer reactions and financial implications. Then they determine whether any changes need to be made to the new product.
