                I received a Google APMM fulltime offer and strongly considered it but ultimately decided I wanted to pursue product management instead of product marketing. I have friends in this program though and have heard wonderful things!

                This is probably the best program for someone who wants to work at a startup, but only one that is highly vetted and relatively low risk (compared to other startups, not compared to like an established big company like Google, of course).

                Product Manager is actually a role that falls under the marketing org at Microsoft. (They also have a more technical PM role known as Program Manager). I almost accepted my Product Manager return offer at Microsoft because I had so much fun interning there.
