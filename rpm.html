          <p><h3>About The Program</h3></p>
          <p>The Facebook RPM program is a community of builders who are given the unique opportunity to create products that help billions of people share and connect with each other. Our mission is to develop future product leaders by empowering, mentoring, and enabling them to build and learn across a variety of products across Facebook.</p>

          <p><h3>Who Joins the RPM Program?</h3></p>
          <p>RPMs come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Some are recent college grads, from a variety of majors including computer science, business, psychology and mechanical engineering. Others have spent a few years working in a range of fields such as consulting, engineering, entrepreneurship and teaching.</p>

          <p><h3>How Long is the RPM Program?</h3></p>
          <p>The program lasts 18 months, and has 3 different Product Management rotations.</p>

          <p><h3>What are Some of the Projects RPMs Have Worked On?</h3></p>
          <p>We've worked on all kinds of products! Here are a few examples:
            <ul>
              <li>Creating a free Internet experience for Internet.org</li>
              <li>Growing peer-to-peer payments in Messenger</li>
              <li>Launching new ad formats optimized for emerging markets</li>
              <li>Discovering improvements for News Feed</li>
              <li>Driving Instagram growth and adoption</li>
              <li>Inventing new consumer apps for Oculus VR</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p><h3>How is Product Management at Facebook Different From Other Companies?</h3></p>
          <p>Facebook optimizes for impact. Our products affect billions of people. We have a responsibility to build high-caliber, daring, empathetic, and collaborative products. The RPM program provides experience, variety and ownership to impact those products.</p>
          <p>The RPM program provides an incredibly supportive community which lasts long after the program ends. RPMs and alums regularly hang out around the Bay Area, organize guest-speakers to give talks at Facebook and travel abroad together to research new technology trends around the world.</p>

          <p><h3>What Does a 'Day In The Life' of a Facebook RPM Look Like?</h3></p>
          <p>There really is no 'typical' day—your days will vary depending on what part of a product's lifecycle you're in. Some of the core responsibilities of RPMs include enabling your team to execute well, ensuring a great product experience and communicating your team’s impact across the company.</p>

          <p><h3>What Kind of Mentorship is Available to RPMs?</h3></p>
          <p>Mentorship is at the core of the RPM program. Each RPM has a PM manager who stays with them throughout their program experience. Your manager is responsible for making sure you're developing and growing in your career. In addition, each rotation is staffed with a PM mentor to guide you through the more tactical pieces of the day-to-day job. The program also provides other resources, such as learning and development classes, internal and external speakers and learnings from peers to help you grow into a well-rounded, versatile and innovative product thinker.</p>

          <p><h3>What Happens After the Program?</h3></p>
          <p>After the program, RPMs utilize their experience, knowledge, and extensive network to identify and join a product team. Facebook makes an investment in each of its RPMs to help them continue making tremendous impact at the company.</p>
